    1.  **Data Setup:** Navigate to the `1_Data_Setup` page from the sidebar to either upload your existing dataset or create a new design space from scratch using the Digital Lab.
    2.  **Experimentation:** On the `2_Experimentation` page, configure your model, set optimization goals, and run the AI to get suggestions for the next best experiment.
    3.  **Results Analysis:** Once an experiment is complete, visit the `3_Results_Analysis` page to dive deep into the results, visualize the data, and understand the model's suggestions.

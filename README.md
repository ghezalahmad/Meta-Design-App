# MetaDesign Dashboard: Material Mix Optimization with MAML and Reptile Models

## üöÄ Project Description
The **MetaDesign Dashboard** is an AI-driven application designed for material mix optimization, leveraging meta-learning techniques such as **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** and **Reptile** models. It facilitates sequential learning for material discovery, drawing inspiration from the **SLAMD (Sequential Learning App for Materials Discovery)** methodology. The primary goal is to accelerate the discovery of sustainable and high-performance materials, such as cementitious composites, while minimizing the need for extensive laboratory experiments.

## üéØ Key Features
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly interface for dataset uploading, model configuration, and visualization.
- **MAML & Reptile Integration:** Allows dynamic switching between MAML and Reptile models for meta-learning.
- **PINN Integration:** Includes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model option to incorporate physical constraints into the learning process.
- **Digital Lab for Design Space Creation:** A powerful feature to generate a design space from scratch. Instead of uploading a dataset, you can define material components, their properties (e.g., cost, density), and constraints. The application then generates a comprehensive dataset of material formulations for the AI models to analyze.
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Supports adaptive learning rates, batch sizes, and epoch settings.
- **Acquisition Function Selection:** Choose between Expected Improvement (EI), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Probability of Improvement (PI).
- **Sequential Learning Strategy:** Iteratively suggest the best candidates for lab testing based on utility, novelty, and uncertainty.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Plotly-based visualizations for exploration vs. exploitation and curiosity impact.
- **Advanced Data Handling:** Supports missing values, a priori information, and batch dataset updates.

## üß† Usage
1. **Choose Your Data Source:**
   - **Upload Dataset:** Upload your material dataset in CSV format.
   - **Create with Digital Lab:** Use the Digital Lab to define material components and generate a design space on the fly.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose between **MAML**, **Reptile**, and **PINN** models.
3. **Configure Parameters:** Adjust hyperparameters, batch size, epochs, and acquisition function. For the PINN model, you can also adjust the `Physics Loss Weight`.
4. **Run Meta-Learning:** Start the training process and evaluate the suggested material candidates.
5. **Visualize Results:** View interactive plots showing the exploration vs. exploitation balance and utility scores.
6. **Select Candidates for Testing:** Use the utility ranking to guide lab experiments.

## üìä Visualization
The application offers dynamic visualizations to illustrate:
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Utility vs. Novelty with Uncertainty as color coding.
- **Curiosity Impact:** Shows how different curiosity settings affect candidate selection.
- **Distributions:** Histograms of utility, novelty, and uncertainty scores.
